## Atif Quamar 

Hi there! I am Atif. Currently working at UCSD on multimodal reasoning. Previously, at Purdue University, I worked on alignment in language models. I am interested in working on problems that help AI reason more intelligently while acting with trustworthiness and security. I founded [Insituate](https://www.insituate.ai) - backed by NVIDIA, Microsoft and Nasscomm, where we built agentic softwares for goverment bodies and financial institions. 

You can learn more about me on my [webpage](https://www.atifquamar.com/).
