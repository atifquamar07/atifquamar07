## Atif Quamar 

Hi there! I am Atif. I am currently a Visiting Researcher at MBZUAI, where I work under the supervision of Dr. Junpei Komiyama. My research focuses on advancing the reasoning capabilities of language models. Previously, at UC San Diego, I worked on improving latent multimodal reasoning in vision-language models, and at Purdue University, my work was focused on inference-time alignment of language models. I founded [Insituate](https://www.insituate.ai) - backed by NVIDIA, Microsoft and Nasscomm, where we built agentic softwares for goverment and financial institutions. 

You can learn more about me on my [webpage](https://www.atifquamar.com/).
